Final Project for Info 448: Mobile App Development (Android)

# Seattle Spot Hunt!

Proposal By Madeleine Stevenson, Joy Phillips, Michel Lew

We are creating Seattle Spot Hunt which is a mobile app aimed at people who want to
experience everything Seattle has to offer by visiting all of its key attractions, but may
need the extra motivation that a scavenger hunt can provide.

It will use location and map services to track when the user has visited certain listed
locations, referred to by the app as pit stops on a predetermined list of locations by the
developers, and rewards them when they do so with progress toward 100% completion.
Information about the different locations (called “pit stops”) will be provided on-demand
in either a list or map view.

User Stories

1. As a user, I want to see a map view of pit stops (interesting locations) to visit inSeattle.
2. As a user, I want to see a list of pit stops to visit in Seattle.
3. As a user, I want to keep track of pit stops that I have been to.
4. As a user, I want to be rewarded for progressing through visiting pit stops.
5. As a user, I want to know information about each pit stop, including its name,location, description, and cost (if appropriate).
6. As a user, I want to be notified if I am within range of a pit stop.
7. But as a user, I also want to be able to turn off notifications of pit stops.

Instructions on using app:

1. Load the app. Make sure that you allow the app to access your location.
2. You'll see the map of Seattle and a marker for each pit stop in the area.
  - In the map, you can click the top right button to automatically go to your current location.
  - Pit stops that have not been visited are green, and once you visit them, they turn blue.
  - You can press on any marker to see the name of the corresponding location.
  - You can also press on the name of the marker to load the description view for it.
3. If you want to see a list of all pit stops, click on the middle tab.
  - You can click on any pit stop to see more details about it here.
4. If you want to see which pit stops you have completed or not completed as well as your overall progress, click the right tab.
  - At the top is your overall progress as a percentage.
  - Below is each pit stop, each will have a checkmark if it has been visited
5. As you walk around in real life, the app will detect if you are getting close to, or have arrived at a pit stop.
