Final Project for Info 448: Mobile App Development (Android)

# Seattle Spot Hunt!

Proposal By Madeleine Stevenson, Joy Phillips, Michel Lew

We are creating Seattle Spot Hunt which is a mobile app aimed at people who want to
experience everything Seattle has to offer by visiting all of its key attractions, but may
need the extra motivation that a scavenger hunt can provide.

It will use location and map services to track when the user has visited certain listed
locations, referred to by the app as pit stops on a predetermined list of locations by the
developers, and rewards them when they do so with progress toward 100% completion.
Information about the different locations (called “pit stops”) will be provided on-demand
in either a list or map view.

User Stories

1. As a user, I want to see a map view of pit stops (interesting locations) to visit inSeattle.
2. As a user, I want to see a list of pit stops to visit in Seattle.
3. As a user, I want to keep track of pit stops that I have been to.
4. As a user, I want to be rewarded for progressing through visiting pit stops.
5. As a user, I want to know information about each pit stop, including its name,location, description, and cost (if appropriate).
6. As a user, I want to be notified if I am within range of a pit stop.
7. But as a user, I also want to be able to turn off notifications of pit stops.
